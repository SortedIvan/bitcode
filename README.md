# Bitcode is a custom built, 8-bit retro text editor. It's built entirely using C++ and the SFML multimedia library (abstraction over OpenGL). 
<br/>
Currently, Bitcode supports opening and creating files only with .txt extension (further files will be added later). 
Some of the features that will be added are: 
 - Multi-line selection
 - Replacing text
 - CTRL+X / CTRL + V / CTRL + C
 - Scaling/Zoom in out
 - Scrolling

<br/>
A visual representation of the current state of bitcode can be seen below.
